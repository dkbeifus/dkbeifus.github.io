# CMPA-3301-D01 Project 3  - Daniel Beifus

This project shows the author can put into practice planning and creating a website.  This assignment builds on all of the previous assignments and is the culmination of all of this semester's material.  

The content for this project was chosen for a real world need to document steps in the media room of a local church.  The steps are real, but any sensitive information has been intentionally left out.  The final product will be hosted here for grading purposes and will be hosted on the church's LAN for media operator's quick reference.
