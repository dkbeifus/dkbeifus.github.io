###What Went Well
The website was finished and loaded with no issues.  The documentation was put together without any trouble.  A draft copy of the website was demonstrated to other system operators with swift approval and some ideas on updating some of the wording.
###What Went Wrong
There is not much to account for in the what went wrong category, but there was an environmental issue that had to be dealt with in the form of a VS Code plugin not working as expected.  I attempted to use the Go Live plugin to see live updates as I wrote the page, but it did not seem to work.  Instead of further troubleshooting, I opted to keep a copy of the page open on my browser and refresh the page after every major change. 
###What To Improve Upon
I think an area where I can improve on the next project or next iteration of this project is time management.  I could have been done with this project sooner, but delayed a little since I knew I had the time to complete it. 
###Summary
The web page and documentation were assembled and verify to work.  A stakeholder demonstration showed optimism and included wording improvements.  The web page has been successfully deployed for use.
