#Project Plan

###Risks

|Risk|Impact|Probability|Score|
|---|---|---|---|
| Not finishing the project on time|5|1|5|
|Power/Internet outage  |3|2|6|
|Others in the media team not accepting the documentation|5|3|15|

###TAME Risks

Out of all of the risks, the one that I think has the biggest chance of being an issue is the risk of other media team members not accepting the documentation.  The plan to handle this risk is to mitigate the risk by demonstrating what the web page can do and seeking input early on.

###Work Breakdown Structure

For planning purposes, the hours breakdown will be in quarter hour increments, so short tasks will be counted as no less than 0.25 hours.
