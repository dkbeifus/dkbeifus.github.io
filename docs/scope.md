# Project Scope

## Project Purpose

The church's media room has been revamped and there is no documented guidance on its use.  This project will produce a web page that will give other system operators a checklist on setting up and running the media room equipment.

## Description

This project will be the first iteration of web page that will provide the media team with guidance on what steps need to be performed.  The main page will be the checklists and an about page will describe the background information about the system design.

## Assumptions

* The checklists are desired for quick referencing
* The web page needs some simple styling in line with the earlier projects

## Desired Results

* Scope document will be named **scope.md**
    
* Main web page document will be named **index.html**

* Main web page to contain the following:
      1.  Use a stylesheet to style the page
      1.  Link to the About page
      1.  A checkable checklist for OBS setup
      1.  A checkable checklist for Freeshow setup
      1.  A checkable checklist for Stream Audio PC setup
      1.  A noncheckable checklist for Starting the service
      1.  A noncheckable checklist for what to do during service
      1.  A noncheckable checklist for Ending the service
  
 * About page document will be named **about.html**

* About page to contain the following:
      1.  Use the same stylesheet as the main web page 
      1.  Link back to the main page
      1.  Provide a high level description of the overall setup
      1.  Provide a high level description of each PC

## Exclusions

- Do **NOT** include any identifiable information since this project will be public and the end use will be on a LAN
- Do **NOT** save the checkbox states since the intent is to provide a reusable list and not to save the data
- Do **NOT** get too detailed; keep it high level for quick referencing.

## Feeedback Loops

Other system operators will give feedback and the feedback will be taken into account for future iterations.

## Risks

Risks will be covered under the project plan.

## Priorities

The priority is to get a checklist into the "hands" of other system operators.  Explaining in more detail will be a future endeavor.

## Acceptance Criteria

This project will be done when the first iteration is written, operational, and tested to be usable from a different computer.  The finished product will then be saved to the LAN and put into regular use.
